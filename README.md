# Ram's Blockchain Cogitations
A collection of my own thoughts on the latest blockchain research. 

## Documentation types

None of these papers are ready for publication. These are unedited assignments submitted for a Master's degree program. While all papers have flaws and maybe too many opinions, they are useful for referencing some cool research.

My technical writing samples are categorized into the following documentation types:

- Case Studies
- Policy/Legal Analysis
- Position and Argumentative Essays
- Technical Reviews
- Mock Project Plans and White Papers
